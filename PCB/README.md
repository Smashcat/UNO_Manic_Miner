# Arduino UNO Manic Miner

Composite output shield for Arduino UNO

This folder contains the files for the PCB that can be used with this project.

+ ./design - the Eagle design files
+ ./images - Schematic and board images
+ ./production-files - These can be used to have the PCB fully assembled at JLCPCB. If using another service, the gerbers should be compatible.

I have also linked sources I used for the NES controller and port that can be soldered to the PCB, below.

## NES controller (aftermarket) - make sure you pick the NES PAD version, NOT the USB version!:
