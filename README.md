# UNO_Manic_Miner
Manic Miner on the Arduino UNO with composite output

This is a project to demonstrate the use of my game engine, that is currently in progress.

Features:

+ Composite output using 2 resistors
+ Scrolling tilemap background
+ Up to 9 16x16 sprites on screen, with up to 7 per scanline
+ 1 sprite has pixel-perfect collision detection against other sprites
+ Fixed framerate of 50fps
+ Effective esolution is 256x256 (no framebuffer, everything is generated by "racing the beam"
+ Lots of spare cycles, enough to run game logic and easily update sprite positions, and even all tile indexes on screen every frame!
+ PCB design for a shield for the Arduino UNO, with buttons, composite output, speaker driving circuit and a an area to mount a Nintendo NES controller port to use instead of the buttons
+ All files for PCB, including production files ready to place a fully assembled order (except for the NES port and header pins) from JLCPCB
